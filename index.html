    <h1>COMP3301/7308 - Operating Systems Architecture</h1>
    <h2>Semester 2, 2012</h2>
    <p>This course is intended to provide in-depth study and understanding of operating
    system implementation. It will prepare you for research in operating systems
    and distributed computing, implementation of novel operating systems or
    existing operating systems on novel devices, and development of device drivers.</p>

    <p>The prescribed textbook for this course is <a href="http://au.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP000141.html">Operating System Concepts (8th Edition)</a> by Silberschatz, Galvin and Gagne. It is published by John Wiley and Sons. Teaching activites will follow this textbook quite closely.</p>

    <h3>Is this course for you?</h3>

    <p>This course is based on understanding operating systems concepts mainly
    using the Linux operating system for examples. It assumes an elementary
    understanding of operating systems concepts and a strong background in C
    programming.</p>

    <p>You should not take this course if you have weak programming skills. A
    good test of whether this course is for you is if you did well in CSSE2310
    (previously known as COMP2303) and enjoyed it. All of the assignments will
    require extensive C programming skills. If you haven't programmed in C, or
    are not willing to put in significant extra effort to learn C in detail, I
    would discourage you from enrolling in the class.</p>

    <p>You should consider taking this course if you want to develop an insight
    into how things work.</p>

    <p>The course is compulsory for the Computer Systems and Networks major in
    BInfTech.</p>
