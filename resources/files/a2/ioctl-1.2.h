 * reader, this call will fail if this fd is open for reading).

/* Sets the mode of standard I/O calls, given by the struct passed as an
 * argument. You must initialise this struct first. The fd does not have
 * to be attached to a buffer for this call to work, since the encryption
 * mode is a property of the file descriptor, not a buffer.
 *
 * This can be called multiple times to set different modes (for instance
 * to set the write mode, and then the read mode).
 *
 * Example to set the device to decrypt on read (where fd is an open file 
 * descriptor to the device):
 *
 *     u8 *key = "this is a key";
 *     struct crypto_smode m;
 *     m.dir = CRYPTO_READ;
 *     m.mode = CRYPTO_DEC;
 *     m.key = key;
 *
 *     int r = ioctl(fd, CRYPTO_IOCSMODE, &m);
 *
 * The structure will be copied from the userspace process' address space
 * by the device driver.
 *
 * Returns one of:
 *     0 on success
 *     -ENOMEM if no memory was available to satisfy the request
 *     -EFAULT if the pointer given is outside the address space of the
 *              user process, or the key cannot be copied to the kernel's
 *              address space
