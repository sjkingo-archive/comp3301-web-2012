    <h2>File systems</h2>
    <p>The goal of this practical is for you to clone <em>ext2</em>, an existing
    (and widely used) file system for Linux and make some small modifications to
    it. Your cloned file system will be named <em>ext3301</em> and you will be
    using it extensively for assignment 3.

    <p><strong>Please note</strong> it is <em>strongly recommended</em> that you do all kernel development
    on the virtual image (we recommend ssh'ing in using <tt>ssh(1)</tt> or Putty on Windows) as it
    is very easy to crash the kernel you are working on while doing development. It is possible you
    may lose data if you work on a physical Linux machine and crash its kernel.</p>

    <hr />
    <h3>Preparing the system</h3>

    <p>Like many other kernel subsystems, file systems are written as kernel modules and can
    either be compiled in to the kernel, or loaded at runtime. We will be using the latter
    method for this prac (and A3).</p>

    <p>Before making a copy of the <em>ext2</em> source tree, you need to install the
    kernel sources (the virtual image only contains the headers, which lacks the C files
    we need). Since the kernel tree is quite large (approximately 65 MB compressed), you
    should ensure your apt mirror is set to the AARNet mirror, which is quota-free from
    the ITEE network. The apt mirror is used whenever the system needs to download a package
    before installing it.</p>

    <h4>Change apt mirror to AARNet</h4>

    <p>To do this, you need to edit <em>/etc/apt/sources.list</em> and set the URLs
    to point to <tt>http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/ubuntu/archive</tt>. This file
    is created by the default system install and is very verbose, containing a lot
    of settings that we don't need, so we will just override the file. Remove the
    file, and recreate it with the following lines only:</p>

    <pre>deb http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/ubuntu/archive lucid main universe
    deb http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/ubuntu/archive lucid-updates main universe
    deb http://mirror.aarnet.edu.au/pub/ubuntu/archive lucid-security main universe
    </pre>

    <p>Now update your package lists off the AARNet mirror by typing <tt>apt-get update</tt>. 
    When this is finished successfully your terminal will say &ldquo;<tt>Reading package lists... Done</tt>&rdquo;.
    <strong>If you do not see that message, stop now and seek assistance from the tutor or newsgroups!</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Be aware that if your apt mirror is not set to the AARNet mirror, the download
        will be counted toward your UQ download quota (if downloading on the ITEE lab computers or UQconnect wireless).
        You have been warned!</strong></p>

    <h4>Installing the kernel source</h4>

    <p>You can now install the kernel source tree by typing: <tt>apt-get install linux-source</tt>. 
    Note that this only downloads the source, so we now have to extract it. The
    source tree is quite large when uncompressed, so you should make sure you have
    at least 500 MB free space on the virtual image before continuing.</p>

    <p>Enter into the <em>/usr/src</em> directory and type: <tt>tar -xjf linux-source*.tar.bz2</tt>.</p>

    <h3>Cloning the ext2 file system</h3>

    <p>You can now gab the <em>ext2</em>
    source code by typing: <tt>cp -rp /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.32/fs/ext2 ext3301</tt> 
    (you will want to do this inside your home directory, probably in an SVN working copy). 
    If this fails with &ldquo;No such file or directory&rdquo;, you probably don't
    have the kernel source tree installed - go back and check to make sure it was
    installed properly.</p>

    <p>Next we must modify the <em>Makefile</em> to build the file system as a
    kernel module, as by default Linux file system drivers are set to build into the
    kernel itself. <a href="../resources/files/ext3301-Makefile-prac.patch">Download the patch</a> for the
    <tt>Makefile</tt> and apply it. (Hint: <tt>patch(1)</tt> might be useful here!)</p>

    <p>Now you can build the kernel module just as you've done in previous pracs - type <tt>make</tt> and
    the kernel's build system will take care of the rest. You should now see a <em>ext3301.ko</em>
    file in your working directory. Try loading this module into the kernel with <tt>insmod</tt>.
    Did it succeed? It shouldn't have!</p>

    <p>The reason loading the module failed was because the module attempted to register itself
    as a file system driver called <em>ext2</em> - a name that the kernel already knows about! The
    kernel will only allow one file system of a given name to be loaded at any given time. To
    fix this, we need to rename our file system to <em>ext3301</em>. Scroll down the bottom of
    <em>super.c</em> and you should see the <tt>init_ext2_fs()</tt> function, which takes the
    form of the module's init function. Find the structure it registers and change the <tt>name</tt>
    member to <em>ext3301</em>. The kernel will now see this as a new file system that can be
    loaded into the kernel (although at this point it just operates exactly as <em>ext2</em>
    does.</p>

    <p>Now type <tt>make</tt> again and try to load the module. Does it work?</p>

    <hr />
    <h3>Creating an <em>ext3301</em> file system</h3>

    <p>Now that the kernel knows about the new file system, we have to create a new 
    image file and format it with an <em>ext3301</em> file system. Since we haven't modified 
    the inode structure, we can use the original <em>ext2</em> formatting tool to create
    this image.</p>

    <p>First, create an empty image file ready to format:</p>
    <p><tt>dd if=/dev/zero of=500K.img bs=500K count=0 seek=1</tt></p>

    <p>This copies 500 KB of data from <tt>/dev/zero</tt> (so, nothing!) to a file called
    <tt>500K.img</tt>. Notice that we gave the count as 0? This tells <tt>dd</tt> to create
    what is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file">sparse file</a>, a
    file that when empty takes up very little space on disk. Compare the output of <tt>ls -hl 500K.img</tt>
    and <tt>du -h 500K.img</tt> for this file and you will see that it takes up less space than 500 KB.</p>

    <p>Now, format the file system (remember that although our file system differs from
    <em>ext2</em> the inode structure remains the same so we can mount <em>ext2</em>-formatted
    file systems with our driver):</p>
    <p><tt>mke2fs 500K.img</tt></p>

    <hr />
    <h3>Mounting the file system</h3>

    <p>Create a mountpoint under the existing file system (do this once only): <tt>mkdir -p /mnt/ext3301</tt>.</p>

    <p>Since Linux can only mount block devices as file systems, we must turn our image
    into a psuedo block device. This is known as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_device">loop device</a>. Luckily,
    the kernel can do this for us automatically when mounting:</p>

    <p><tt>mount -t ext3301 -o loop 500K.img /mnt/ext3301</tt></p>

    <p>Note that we specified <tt>-t ext3301</tt> - this is the file system type and it tells
    the kernel to use your file system driver when accessing this mountpoint (if you omit it the
    kernel will probably autoselect the driver for <em>ext2</em> which we don't want). The <tt>-o loop</tt>
    mount option tells the kernel that we are mounting something that isn't a block device and it should
    set up a loop mount.</p>

    <p>Try creating a new file and directory in the file system under <em>/mnt/ext3301</em>.</p>

    <p>When you have finished with the file system (or wish to reload your driver), you must
    unmount the loop device with <tt>umount /mnt/ext3301</tt>.</p>

    <hr />

    <p>You are now ready to start working on assignment 3 when it is released. We <strong>strongly recommend</strong>
    reading up on the internals of <em>ext2</em> now: it will be invaluable when you start assignment 3.</p>

    <p>A good document on <em>ext2</em> is located in the kernel source documentation: under <a href="http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/ext2.txt">Documentation/filesystems/ext2.txt</a>.</p>
