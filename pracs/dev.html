    <h2>Setting up a development environment</h2>

    <p>This guide will help you get set up using the COMP3301 virtual image
    inside VMware Player, which you will use for assignments 2 and 3 and their
    associated practicals.</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>Set up the basic image</h3>

    <p>First, you must download the image off the EAIT labs network. There are
    two ways to do this, as shown on the <a href="../resources/">Resources
        page</a> (if you are on your own computer, you must use SCP to copy
    it). Download and extract it to a USB HDD or your own computer - do not put
    it on your student drive or the local labs computers!</p>

    <p>If you are on your own computer, you must now install VMware Player (if
    you don't already have it). Again, follow the instructions on the <a
        href="../resources/">Resources page</a>. If you are using the EAIT labs
    computers, they already have it installed.</p>

    <p>Once installed, open VMware Player and browse for the
    <tt>COMP3301-VM.vmx</tt> file to add the existing machine and start it.
    Once the machine has started, you can log in to the machine using the
    username and password <tt>comp3301</tt>.</p>

    <hr />

    <p><strong>Please note</strong> that marking of assignments 2 and 3 will take place
    on a clean image that is provided on the course website, so we highly
    recommend you <strong>do not update</strong> any packages or the kernel on
    your development machine! Do so at your own risk!</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>Virtual machine networking</h3>

    <p>You may notice that networking does not initially work in the virtual
    machine. Try and look around the system and find out why this is the case.
    Hint: try using tools such as <tt>ping</tt>, <tt>ifconfig</tt>, etc. Once
    you have figured out what the problem is, follow the instructions on the <a
        href="../resources/">Resources page</a> to fix this.</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>Subversion checkout</h3>

    <p>Before starting on any assignments, it is recommended you checkout and set up your Subversion
    repository. A <a href="subversion.html">Subversion cheat sheet</a> is available for your reference.</p>

    <p>Check out a working copy of your repository and create a tracked directory <tt>test</tt>. In it,
    create a simple <tt>Hello, world</tt> program with a <tt>Makefile</tt> that will build it. Confirm
    that it compiles and runs with no warnings or errors (you should always compile with the <tt>-Wall</tt>
    compile flag to <tt>gcc</tt>). Make sure you commit any <tt>.c</tt> files and your <tt>Makefile</tt>
    to the test directory.</p>

    <p>Try checking out a fresh copy of your repository in another directory and 
    confirm your test program still works. If it doesn't, maybe you forgot to commit part of your source?</pp>

    <p>Now, create a tracked directory called <tt>a0</tt> in the root of your
    repository. This is where you will keep your assignment 0 source code
    files.  Try checking out the directory specified in the assignment 0
    specification (substituting your own student number) to make sure you've
    placed the <tt>a0</tt> subdirectory in the correct location. You may lose
    marks on assignments if you don't use the expected directory structure.</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>SSH access to the virtual machine</h3>

    <p>You've probably noticed how cumbersome it is to do development directly in the virtual machine
    console in VMware player. We recommend you SSH in to your virtual machine from the host using 
    <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a> (on Windows) or <tt>ssh(1)</tt> (on Linux/Mac). You should be familiar with using SSH from previous courses. Find out the IP address of
    the virtual machine (hint: the interface should be called <tt>eth0</tt>) and try and connect to it
    from your host machine.</p>

    <hr />

    <h3>Recommended editors</h3>

    <p>We highly recommend using a Unix editor such as <tt>vim</tt> to develop
    your assignments. It can be set up with syntax highlighting and
    auto-indenting to make following the style guide trivial. Try setting up a
    basic <tt>.vimrc</tt> that switches syntax highlighting and auto-indenting
    on.</p>

    <p>Please do not check in any code with Windows line endings, it makes our
    jobs as markers more difficult as we have to convert your code to Unix line
    feeds before we can look at your code! Think of the people who are awarding
    you marks before using a Windows editor!</p>
