    <h2>Pth internals</h2>

    <p>The goal of this practical is to give you hand&rsquo;s-on experience 
    modifying the Pth library internals. You will need this knowledge for
    assignment 1. You should not attempt this prac until you have completed
    the previous prac, <a href="intro-pth.html">Intro to Pth</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="useful-source-files">Useful source files</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><em>pth_tcb.c</em> - definition of <tt>struct pth_st</tt></li>
        <li><em>pth_lib.c</em> - home of <tt>pth_spawn()</tt>, which is called to create a new thread</li>
        <li><em>pth_sched.c</em> - Pth scheduler, the &ldquo;heart&rdquo; of Pth</li>
        <li><em>pth_pqueue.c</em> - priority queue implementation, used by the scheduler for its thread queues</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="struct_pth_st"><tt>struct pth_st</tt></h2>

    <p>The <tt>pth_st</tt> structure stores all of the information on threads. Each thread has exactly
    one such structure assigned to it. After building the source, you will see the structure in 
    <em>pth_p.h</em>. Add an integer member to the structure (such as <tt>int foo;</tt>) and perform the following steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li><tt>make clean</tt></li>
        <li><tt>make</tt></li>
    </ol>

    <p>Now have a look back in <em>pth_p.h</em>. Where did <tt>foo</tt> go? The problem here is that the
    Pth source auto-generates the header file off another file - <em>pth_tcb.c</em>. If you wish to
    modify the structure, you must make the changes in the thread control block file. Try adding the
    <tt>foo</tt> variable into the <tt>.c</tt> file specified and rebuild the source. You should now
    see that it is always populated in the header file.</p>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>Where can you initialise members of the thread control block structure? Initialise your integer value to 5.</em></p>

    <h2 id="debugging-calls">Making debugging calls</h2>

    <p>Recall from the previous prac that building the Pth library with debugging enabled produces
    a fair amount of output on what the library is doing, and its internal state. This is very
    useful during development and you too can output messages of your own. To write debugging
    output to the screen, there are a number of <tt>printf()</tt>-style functions to help you,
    named <tt>pth_debug1()</tt> through to <tt>pth_debug6()</tt>. You can use them as follows:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><tt>pth_debug1(string)</tt> - simple string with no formatting</li>
        <li><tt>pth_debug2(format, arg1)</tt> - format string with one argument</li>
        <li><tt>pth_debug3(format, arg1, arg2)</tt> - format string with two argument</li>
        <li><em>etc.</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>For instance, to print out a single argument you would use:</p>

    <p><pre>char *str = "hello";
    pth_debug2("Value is: %s", str);</pre></p>

    <p>Let's say we wanted to print out some information when a thread is created. Find the <tt>pth_spawn()</tt>
    function and just before it returns, print (using debugging) the following members of the thread's control block:

    <ul>
        <li>Its name</li>
        <li>Its priority</li>
        <li>The value of the <tt>foo</tt> member you added</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>Which</em> <tt>pth_debug</tt> <em>function do you need to use for the above?</em></p>

    <p>Rebuild the source and use a test program to create a new thread. You should be able to see the output of your
    debugging print when the program is run (hint: try <tt>grep</tt>ping the output for it).</p>

    <h2 id="pth-scheduler">The Pth scheduler</h2>

    <p>The scheduler is responsible for coordinating and controlling which threads
    run next, and for dispatching signals and events to waiting threads. Threads
    will run for 100 ms at which time they will be preempted if they haven't
    already yielded.</p>

    <p>Pth's scheduler is mostly implemented in the <em>pth_sched.c</em> file. By looking through this file you should see that it is responsible for
    picking new threads to run, and performing general housekeeping (such as moving threads between
    priority queues, dispatching any signals, checking for stack overflows, <em>etc.</em>).</p>

    <p>Create some simple threads that loop forever and others than yield after
    doing some work. Examine the behaviour of the scheduler and determine what type
    of scheduling algorithm it implements. Does it pick threads fairly?</p>
