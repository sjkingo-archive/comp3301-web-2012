    <h2>Introduction to Pth</h2>

    <p>The goal of this practical is to introduce you to Pth, the GNU Portable 
    threading library. It will walk you through how to use the library, including
    building it and creating a test program that links against it.</p>

    <h2 id="whatis">What is Pth?</h2>

    <p>Pth is the GNU Portable Threads library, a C library that provides multithreading
    capabilities to user-space processes. It is similar to pthreads (which you
    should be familiar with from CSSE2310), except it operates completely in
    user-space &mdash; the kernel is not aware of the multiple threads of
    execution inside the user-space process.</p>

    <p>With Pth, multiple threads of execution can exist inside one process. The kernel
    only &lsquo;sees&rsquo; this single process, and as such will schedule it as normal.
    When the process is given a scheduling slice by the kernel, one of the Pth threads
    that exist in the process will be run.</p>

    <p>The original Pth library implements cooperative multithreading, but we
    have patched it to replace this with a preemptive scheduler. All of your
    work on the Pth library will be with this version, including assignment
    1.</p>

    <p>It is <em>highly recommended</em> that you read the manual page for Pth
    before using it, as it contains detailed information on the library and its
    behaviour, which will be an invaluable resource to you. You will find the
    <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/pth">Pth manual page here</a>.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2 id="building">Building Pth</h2>

    <p>For this course we will be using version 2.0.7-preempt of Pth.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Download Pth from <a href="../resources/files/pth-2.0.7-preempt.tar.gz">the course website</a></li>
        <li>Download the <a href="../resources/files/build-pth.sh">build script</a></li>
        <li>Make the script executable with <tt>chmod +x build-pth.sh</tt></li>
        <li>Run <tt>./build-pth.sh --help</tt> for instructions</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Running <tt>./build-pth.sh --help</tt> should show you that you will need to
    run it with the <tt>--extract</tt> argument for the first time, to ensure the
    source tree is extracted, once this is done once you should not need to use
    <tt>--extract</tt> again.</p>

    <p><em>Run the build script now, and take note of how long it takes to build. Now,
        run it again see how long it takes. Why do you think there is such a difference?</em></p>

    <p>The bottom of the build script's output shows you the libraries that
    have been installed.  You should see two: one with a <tt>.a</tt> extension,
    and one with a <tt>.so</tt> extension.  <tt>.a</tt> is a
    statically-linkable library, that can be linked into a program at
    compile-time.</p> The <tt>.so</tt> file is a dynamic library, which allows
    a program to link against the library at runtime.</p>

    <p>You will end up using both types of libraries during your Pth development time (but not in this prac).</p>

    <hr />

    <h2 id="test-program">A simple test program</h2>

    <p>We call into the Pth library in much the same way as any other C
    library, but there is one important distinction: we must ensure we
    don't make any system calls that block.  Pth schedules threads entirely in
    user-space, without any help from the kernel, which means that the kernel
    has no way to know that there are other threads in our process which might
    be ready to run while we wait for our blocking system call to return.
    Instead the kernel will block <em>all</em> threads in our process, causing
    starvation.</p>

    <p>Pth provides wrappers around most of the blocking system calls, and you must call
    these instead. They are prefixed with <tt>pth_</tt> (for example, <tt>pth_sleep()</tt>.)
    These wrappers dispatch to a non-blocking version of the required system call and notify
    the calling thread once it is complete. This allows other threads to run in the meantime.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>Does thread-safety matter when running threads in Pth? Why or why
        not? Have a read of the manual page for</em> <tt>ctime(3)</tt> <em>for some tips
        (especially the</em> <tt>NOTES</tt> <em>section).</em></p>

    <p>We start off with our <tt>main()</tt> function:</p>
        
<pre>
int main(void)
{
    /* must be called first: sets up system threads and turns us into the
     * main control thread
     */
    pth_init();

    /* spawn some new threads */
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
        pth_spawn(PTH_ATTR_DEFAULT, thread_func, NULL);
    }

    /* sleep the main thread for 15 seconds... this allows the other threads
     * to continue running
     */
    pth_sleep(15);
}
</pre>

    <p>As you can see, we&rsquo;ve left out the <tt>thread_func</tt> function: this is
    a task for you to create (see the next section).</p>

    <p>The main function above introduces you to a few of the function calls that
    exist in the Pth library:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><tt>pth_init()</tt> &mdash; initialises the library and sets up the
        process ready for threading</li>
        <li><tt>pth_spawn()</tt> &mdash; similar to <tt>pthread_create()</tt>, this
        function is used to create a new thread that will be run</li>
        <li><tt>pth_sleep()</tt> &mdash; the Pth-safe version of <tt>sleep()</tt></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>What does the</em>
    <tt>PTH_ATTR_DEFAULT</tt> <em>definition mean when given as the first
        argument? What would you call if you wanted a non-default
        attribute?</em></p>

    <h3 id="test-program-func">The thread function</h3>

    <p>Your task is to write the <tt>thread_func</tt> function which will have
    the following prototype:</p>

    <pre>static void *thread_func(void *arg)</pre>

    <p>(the <tt>arg</tt> argument is unused in this example). Each thread
    should <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_waiting">busy-wait</a>
    for 1 second, print out "yielding now", and then yield (see the <tt>pth_yield()</tt> function). This
    process should be repeated five times, after which the thread should exit.
    The <tt>time(2)</tt> system call would be useful for this.</p>

    <p>Observe the behaviour of the test program with <tt>top(1)</tt> and
    <tt>ps(1)</tt> (to get <tt>top</tt> to display individual threads, type
    <tt>H</tt> in <tt>top</tt>). Think about how many processes are running,
    how long they run for, how the threads behave, etc.</p>

    <hr />

    <h2 id="linking-running">Linking and running the test program</h2>

    <p>Some extra compile and linker flags need to be provided when compiling
    and linking the test program (and any program that uses Pth). You can download
    a <a href="../resources/files/pth-Makefile">sample Makefile here</a> (make sure you
    rename it to <tt>Makefile</tt>).</p>

    <p>For example, the extra flags that need to be given are:</p>
<pre>
PTH_CONFIG=pth-2.0.7-preempt/pth-config

CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-Wall -Wextra -g -std=gnu99 $(shell $(PTH_CONFIG) --cflags)
LDFLAGS=$(shell $(PTH_CONFIG) --ldflags) -Wl,-rpath,$(shell $(PTH_CONFIG) --libdir)
LIBS=$(shell $(PTH_CONFIG) --libs)
</pre>

    <p>where <tt>PTH_CONFIG</tt> is the path to the <tt>pth-config</tt> program.</p>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>What does the</em> <tt>-Wl,-rpath,...</tt> <em>
    argument to the linker do?</em></p>

    <h3 id="linking-running-debug">Debugging output</h3>

    <p>Pth allows debugging output to be printed to the terminal while a program linked
    against it is running. This is very useful and is an invaluable resource during
    testing, to see what the Pth library is doing.</p>

    <p>Enabling this debugging output requires rebuilding the Pth source with
    debugging enabled, which can be achieved by running the
    <tt>build-pth.sh</tt> shell script with the <tt>--debug</tt> argument.

    <hr />

    <h2 id="exploring">Exploring Pth</h2>

    <p>Write a test program that spawns some &lsquo;greedy&rsquo; threads
    &mdash; threads that consume a lot of CPU time without yielding &mdash; 
    and one or two &lsquo;lean&rsquo; threads that yield often. Observe the output
    of the Pth debugging and try to get a feel for how long each thread is spending
    executing before yielding.</p>

    <h3 id="exploring-pth-vs-pthreads">Pth vs Pthreads</h3>

    <p>You should see by now that there are limitations of running a threading
    library in user-space without kernel support. Recreate the test program
    created above but this time use Pthreads. Remember that since Pthreads has
    kernel support, threads may call blocking system calls.
    Run them both at once and compare the differences in behaviour in
    <tt>top(1)</tt> and <tt>ps(1)</tt>. How many processes does the Pthreads
    version use?  What is the CPU usage like?</p>

    <h3 id="exploring-signals">Signals</h3>

    <p>What happens when you send a signal to an individual thread, running
    with pthreads? Try <tt>kill -SIGHUP pid</tt> (where <tt>pid</tt> is one of
    the running thread&rsquo;s process id&rsquo;s). Did you expect this
    behaviour? Now try again with Pth.</p>
