    <h2>Hello Kernel World - Introduction to kernel modules</h2>

    <p>The goal of this practical is a simple hello world &lsquo;program&rsquo; &mdash;
    running in kernel-space. To do this, we will introduce you to kernel modules,
    which you will be using to write your solutions for the following assignments with.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Please note</strong> it is <em>strongly recommended</em> that you do all kernel development
    on the virtual image (we recommend ssh'ing in using <tt>ssh(1)</tt> or Putty on Windows) as it
    is very easy to crash the kernel you are working on while doing development. It is possible you
    may lose data if you work on a physical Linux machine and crash its kernel.</p>

    <h2 id="whatis">What is a kernel module</h2>

    <p>A kernel module allows us to load new features into a running Linux kernel without
    rebuilding its entire source or rebooting the machine. This is a very useful feature
    for many reasons, but the one we are most concerned with is that it makes development
    much more efficient. Instead of rebuilding the Linux source tree on every modification
    (which can take anywhere from 5 minutes to 1 hour), we keep our code for the module
    outside of the kernel source tree.</p>

    <p>Not everything can be done outside of the kernel source tree. For instance
    modifying the scheduler requires you to modify the core of the kernel &mdash; modifications
    in this fashion cannot be loaded in at runtime. Device drivers and file systems are
    two types of modules that can be loaded with ease.</p>

    <p><strong>Question:</strong> <em>why do you think the scheduler must be
    built into the kernel instead of being loaded as a module?</em></p>

    <p>More information on the concept of kernel modules can be found on <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loadable_kernel_module">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="anatomy">Anatomy of a kernel module</h2>

    <p>At a bare minimum a kernel module requires two callback functions: the
    initialiser (which is called when the kernel loads the module), and a
    cleanup function (which is called when the kernel unloads the module).
    These functions are comparible in concept to class constructors and
    deconstructors in object-oriented programming languages.</p>

    <h3 id="anatomy-init">init function</h3>

    <p>The initialiser function (a common shorthand for this is the <em>init
        function</em>) takes no arguments and returns an integer. This return
    code is used to determine whether the kernel should continue loading the
    module. If the return evaluates to greater than 0, then the kernel will
    unload the module.</p>

    <pre>
    int __init init_module(void)
    {
        printk(KERN_INFO "Hello, kernel world!\n");
        return 0;
    }
    </pre>

    <p>Convention dictates that the function is named <tt>init_module</tt> so the
    kernel can recognise this is the function that should be called when the module
    is loaded. You will note the <tt>__init</tt> symbol between the return type and
    the function name. This is a bit different to normal C programs, but is a
    common thing in the world of kernel development. <tt>__init</tt> is a
    preprocessor definition that instructs the kernel to discard the memory used by
    the function after it returns (since it will only be called once over a
    module&rsquo;s lifetime).</p>

    <p>Inside the function, there is a call to a function that you may not have
    seen before &mdash; <tt>printk()</tt>. This is the kernel&rsquo;s version of
    <tt>printf()</tt> and allows us to talk to the outside world. The arguments
    are the same as the standard <tt>printf()</tt> call, except we prefix the 
    format string with a logging level. In the case of our example, we used
    <tt>KERN_INFO</tt>. This is a preprocessor definition that will expand out
    to a prefix string that, due to the way C handles consecutive string constants,
    will concatenate together (note that there is no comma between the prefix and
    the format string).</p>

    <p>We will talk about where the output from this call goes later on.</p>

    <p>And that&rsquo;s it for out init function. When loaded, the kernel will
    execute the <tt>init_module()</tt> function and something will be printed
    &mdash; but where will this output go?</p>

    <p>In a standard C program that is run from a terminal, the output from
    <tt>printf()</tt> is directed to the terminal and appears on the screen
    (unless redirected to a file). But in the kernel, where does this output
    go? The answer is dmesg.</p>

    <h3 id="anatomy-dmesg">dmesg</h3>

    <p>dmesg is used to print the contents of the kernel's buffer. This is where the
    output of <tt>printk()</tt> goes. Find the last couple of messages that the kernel
    has printed by typing <tt>dmesg | tail</tt> into a terminal.</p>

    <h3 id="anatomy-cleanup">cleanup function</h3>

    <p>We have already created the init function for our module, but now we need
    to write a cleanup function that will be called when the module is unloaded.
    It gives us one final chance to clean up and free any memory before the module
    is removed from the kernel.</p>

    <pre>
    void __exit cleanup_module(void)
    {
        printk(KERN_INFO "Goodbye, kernel world!\n");
    }
    </pre>

    <p>In our simple cleanup function, we simply print out that the module is being
    unloaded. This output will go to dmesg as described above.</p>

    <h3 id="anatomy-metadata">Module metadata</h3>

    <p>Each module has some metadata attached to it, such as its author and
    description, but more importantly, the license it is released under. We have to
    declare this otherwise the module will <em>taint</em> the kernel - meaning
    there is a module running that is not compatible with the same GPL license
    Linux is released under. For this course, we will declare that our modules are
    licensed under the GPL.</p>

    <p>Insert the following metadata into your module's source, just above any
    functions:</p>

    <pre>
    MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
    MODULE_AUTHOR("Your name here");
    MODULE_DESCRIPTION("A simple hello world kernel module");
    </pre>

    <h3 id="anatomy-includes">Includes</h3>

    <p>Since we have called quite a few functions and macros, and used some
    preprocessor definitions, we need to tell the compiler where to find the
    definitions. For our hello world program, we need 3 includes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><tt>#include &lt;linux/module.h&gt;</tt> &mdash; required by
        every kernel module and should be first in the includes list</li>
        <li><tt>#include &lt;linux/kernel.h&gt;</tt> &mdash; this gives us the
        definitions for <tt>KERN_INFO</tt> and <tt>printk()</tt></li>
        <li><tt>#include &lt;linux/init.h&gt;</tt> &mdash; defines the <tt>__init</tt>
        and <tt>__exit</tt> keywords</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Place these at the very top of the source file.</p>

    <hr />
    <h2 id="building">Building a kernel module</h2>

    <p>Now that we have written the kernel module, we need a way of compiling it
    ready for the kernel to load. The kernel's build system can take care of this
    for the most part, but we still need to set up our own Makefile so make can
    create the module.</p>

    <pre>
    OBJ=helloworld.o

    obj-m += $(OBJ)
    MOD_DIR=/lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build

    .PHONY: all
    all:
        make -C $(MOD_DIR) M=$(PWD) modules

    .PHONY: clean
    clean:
        make -C $(MOD_DIR) M=$(PWD) clean
    </pre>

    <p>Try and understand what the Makefile above does (hint: try looking at the
    manpage for <tt>make(1)</tt>) and explain it to your tutor to show you
    understand how it works.</p>

    <hr />
    <h2 id="running">Loading and unloading</h2>

    <h3 id="running-loading">Loading &mdash; <tt>insmod</tt></h3>

    <p>To insert a module into the kernel, we use a program called <tt>insmod</tt>,
    like so:</p>

    <pre>sudo insmod hello.ko</pre>

    <p>If the module was loaded successfully, <tt>insmod</tt> returns status 0.
    Have a look at dmesg to see the module's init function printing hello world.</p>

    <h3 id="running-listing">Listing &mdash; <tt>lsmod</tt></h3>

    <p>Sometimes it is useful to see if a kernel module is currently loaded, and how
    much space the code is taking up in the kernel. To do this, we use a program
    called <tt>lsmod</tt> without any arguments. Go ahead and type it now, you should
    see your module in the (possibly quite long) list.</p>

    <h3 id="running-unloading">Unloading &mdash; <tt>rmmod</tt></h3>

    <p>To unload a module when we are finished with it (or we have rebuilt it and wish to 
    reload it), type:</p>

    <pre>sudo rmmod hello.ko</pre>

    <p>Unloading a module is not guaranteed to work, as the kernel will not allow a
    module to be unloaded if other modules or user-space programs are using it. More
    details on this will be provided in the next practical.</p>
